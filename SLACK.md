# F5 Slack Workspace Information

F5 has created a [Slack workspace](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com) for community discussions and assistance with F5 solutions.  

This page is to clarify what to expect from the Slack workspace and provide guidelines on usage.  

There are F5 employees who are members of the Slack community. They typically monitor the workspace Monday to Friday, from 9am to 5pm PST, and will offer ***best-effort assistance***.  
This slack workspace community support should **not** be considered a substitute for F5 Technical Support.  

On the Slack workspace, you should **NEVER**:

- Enter any private or personally identifying information about you, your network, organization and so on.
- Enter any passwords/credentials, logs, or IP addresses/hostnames etc.
- Try to open an F5 technical support case through the Slack workspace.
- Expect that F5 technical support monitors or uses this workspace; they do not.
- Expect that an F5 employee will always immediately respond on Slack. Employees will offer best-effort assistance, but there may be times when responses are delayed.
